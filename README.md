## üéØ Inspiration
Many people with autism struggle to read facial expressions or emotional cues, which can lead to stress and isolation.

## üêò What it does
MoodSee helps users identify the emotions of the person they‚Äôre speaking to through simple visual cues inside the headset.

The app uses the headset‚Äôs passthrough-video data and sends images to ChatGPT to analyze facial expressions in (almost) real time and translate them to simple visuals above the speaker.

## üõ†Ô∏è How we built it
- Using Meta Building Blocks,
- BlazeFace for Face Detection 
- OpenAI ChatGPT 4o for Emotion Detection
- Vercel for the OpenAI Interface 
- Unity-PassthroughCameraApiSamples to get a grip of the Acces on the Quest 3 Passthrough Camera

## üöß Challenges we ran into
Face tracking in the headset:
The original AI models were trained on cropped faced, which is not what the headset is seeing. 
This forced us to switch to ChatGPT, which came with its own challenges. 
Getting access to camera access was an issue at first. 
Designing visuals that communicate emotion effectively without being distracting or stressful.

## üèÜ Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting the emotion recognition pipeline to work

## üìö What we learned
- How to use Meta-PCA
- Set up inference and ran RoboFlow AI
- Used face-tracking locally on the Quest
- Sent images to ChatGPT for recognition, including emotions
- Worked with voice recognition and built actions from it

## üéØ Target Group
MoodSee is designed for neurodiverse users, especially those with autism, who struggle to interpret facial expressions during conversation. It acts as a real-time emotional assistant to reduce social friction and support smoother face-to-face communication.

## ‚è≠Ô∏è What's next for MoodSee by Empaths XR
- User testing!
- Local live tracking to remove reliance on ChatGPT or third-party libraries
- Consent feature that allows users to ask conversation partners for permission
- Voice detection to add another layer of emotional context
- Pet emotion tracking
